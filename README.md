# gravitational-wave-around-two-spinning-black-holes-in-orbital-motion

This code provides an educational animation of two spinning black holes and the associated gravitational waves, capturing the dynamics of these phenomena over time. While the animation inherently incorporates aspects of all four dimensions of spacetime, including the three spatial dimensions (X, Y, and Z) and the temporal dimension (time), it does so with simplifications and visualizations that make the concepts more accessible for educational purposes. The code visually illustrates the motion of black holes and the propagation of gravitational waves, emphasizing their interplay over time. However, it is crucial to understand that this animation is a didactic tool designed to aid in the understanding of these complex topics. It simplifies the intricacies described by General Theory of Relativity (GTR), including the orbital motion of black holes, which is presented here in a simplified form for educational clarity rather than as an accurate representation of GTR's predictions
